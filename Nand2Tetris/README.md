This project follows the Nand2Tetris course. Learn more here: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

In each sub project there is a sample output to display what the program produces. In the Computer_hdl_work there is a highlighted work folder which shows examples of chips I built in hdl and assembly I wrote.

In the first part of the course I built a modern computer from first principals.
I began with basic logic gates and worked up the layers of abstraction building chips of increasing complexity in hdl (hardware development language). 
I concluded with building a fully fledged 16-bit Hack computer. 

In the second part I learned 16-bit machine code and began by building an assembler. Next I built a VM that creates the stack and function abstractions which translates down to assembly. Finally I built a token parser that compiles from Jack (a Java like language) into nested tokenized XML. The course guides you through the principals and objectives but leaves the actual work to the student. For exmple they may explain what a VM instruction should accomplish but not how to translate it into assembly.
